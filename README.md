Grade 12 Culminating Project

I made this for my ICS4U Culminating in Grade 12. It won't work outside of my school's network, because of the way that my teacher set up the server, but I'll still put it here as a project just to show some experience

The site would calculate what percentage students would need to obtain on their final assessment in order to get their target grade, based on their current grade. The 3 values inputed by the user are their current grade in the course, their target grade, and the weight of their final exam.
